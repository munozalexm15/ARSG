## TODO:

###BUGS:
 - If players start reloading both guns, if it switches weapons fast enough the ammo mag stacks

###GUN PLAY
 - Create "Aiming" state for player (slower speed, less bobbing / sway, etc.)
 
##WEAPON LIST
 - Shotgun
 - AR
 - Silenced weapons
 - Weapon variations

###WEAPON FEEL
 - Bullet impact decals
 - Camera zoom when shooting
 - Add clipping gun prevention
 - Tweak states transitions (IE: Players cancel the swap weapon action if they start running)

###UI / HUD
 - Menu
 - Show ammo
 - Show player state (crouched, running, standing -> like COD1)
 - Show Health(maybe?)
 
###OTHER:
 - Clean weapon / hands code
 - Make pickup variations of M14 and USP
