## TODO:

###BUGS:
 - When crouching, if sprinting the state machine transitions to walk and then to run, but the camera position still is as crouched

###GUN PLAY
 - Add limitations (disable shooting if changing weapon, etc.)
 - Create "Aiming" state for player (slower speed, less bobbing / sway, etc.)
##WEAPON LIST
 - Shotgun
 - AR
 - Silenced weapons
 - Weapon variations

###WEAPON FEEL
 - Bullet impact decals
 - Camera zoom when shooting
 - Add clipping gun prevention
 - Tweak states transitions (IE: Players cancel the swap weapon action if they start running)

###UI / HUD
 - Menu
 - Show ammo
 - Show Health(maybe?)
 
###OTHER:
 - Clean weapon / hands code
 - Make pickup variations of MP5 and USP
